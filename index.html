      <b>                Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu</b>, MC (pronounced [bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as 
      <b>Mother Teresa</b>, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity.
      She was born <b>Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu</b> in Skopje, part of the Ottoman Empire at the time.[b] At the
      age of 18, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016,
      she was canonised as <b>Saint Teresa of Calcutta</b>. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast
      day.

      Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500 nuns
      across 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS,
      leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's
      and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity,
      poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of
      the poor.

      Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979
      Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by
      many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the
      poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was
      published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa 
      and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.

     <h1><b>  Biography</b></h1>
     <br><hr>
     <h2><b>   Early life</b></h2>
      Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)[8][page needed] Bojaxhiu (Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə
     ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]—Anjezë is a cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower" in Albanian.
      She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family[9][10][11] in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the
     capital of North Macedonia).[12][13] She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth.[8] She later considered
      27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".[12]

      She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).[14] Her father, who was involved in
      Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.[12][c] He was
      born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania).[15][16] Her
      mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,[17] believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin.[18]

     According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated 
     by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she
     should commit herself to religious life.[19] Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the
     shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages.[20]

     Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to
     learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters
     of Loreto in India.[21] She saw neither her mother nor her sister again.[22] Her family lived in Skopje until
     1934, when they moved to Tirana.[23]

     She arrived in India in 1929[24] and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,[25] where she
     learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.[26] She took her first religious vows on
     24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries;[27][28]
     because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.[29]

     Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in
     Entally, eastern Calcutta, taking the style of 'Mother' as part of Loreto custom.[12][30][31] She served there for
     nearly twenty years and was appointed its headmistress in 1944.[32] Although Mother Teresa enjoyed
     teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta.[33] The
     Bengal famine of 1943 brought misery and death to the city, and the August 1946 Direct Action Day began a
     period of Muslim-Hindu violence.[34]

     In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling by train, Mother Teresa felt that she heard the call of her inner conscience
     to serve the poor of India for Jesus. She asked for and received permission to leave the school. In 1950, she
     founded the Missionaries of Charity, choosing a white sari with two blue borders as the order's habit.

      On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she
      travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the
      convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the
      faith."[35] Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become
      Mother Teresa".[36]

      She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[24] replacing her
      traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue
      border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several
      months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family
      Hospital and ventured into the slums.[37][38] She founded a school in
      Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and
      hungry.[39] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her
      effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a
      new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".[40]

      Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including
       the prime minister.[41] Mother Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no
       income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to
       the comfort of convent life during these early months:

       Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a
       good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I
       walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body
       and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former
       congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only to say the word and all that will be yours
       again", the Tempter kept on saying. ... Of free choice, my God, and out of love for you, I desire
       to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear come.[42]

       The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and 
       leper houses throughout India.Mother Teresa then expanded the congregation abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters.[50] 
        Houses followed in Italy (Rome),Tanzania and Austria in 1968, and, during the 1970s,the congregation opened houses and foundations in 
        the United States and dozens of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.[51]

       The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters followed in
       1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa,
       the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity.

       Responding to requests by many priests, in 1981, Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests[52]
       and with Joseph Langford founded the Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the Missionaries 
       of Charity with the resources of the priesthood.[53]

       By 1997, the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centers
       worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.[54] By 2007,
      the Missionaries of Charity numbered about 450 brothers and 5,000 sisters worldwide, operating 600 missions, schools and shelters in 120 countries.[55]
